# Study Buddies

Study Buddies is a MERN stack application that helps students at the University of Central Florida (UCF) to create and join study groups. With Study Buddies, you can easily search for study groups by subject, course, or location, and join existing groups or create your own. We also have a mobile app built with React Native for on-the-go access.


## Key Project Takeaways

**Design Patterns:** In developing Study Buddies, we employed various design patterns to improve the overall architecture of our code. We used the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate our application's concerns, and the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of a class is created.

**Data Structures and Algorithms:** We used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and hash tables to efficiently store and manage data within our application. We also used algorithms such as sorting and searching to optimize the performance of our search functionality.

**Security:** Security is a top priority in Study Buddies. We employed various security measures, such as password hashing and Mongoose, to protect our users' sensitive information.

## Features

* User authentication and authorization
* Search for study groups by subject, course, or location
* Create and join study groups
* View study group details and members
* Search for UCF classes

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* React Native
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB with Mongoose


## What Went Well

Throughout the development process, several aspects of the project went well:

**Effective Communication:** We used Scrum and Jira for project management, which helped us to stay on track and communicate effectively as a team.

**Collaborative Coding:** We used pair programming and code reviews to ensure that our code was of high quality and consistent throughout the project.

**Responsive Design:** We used a mobile-first design approach, which made it easy to adapt the application for both web and mobile platforms.

## Struggles and Challenges

While developing Study Buddies, we encountered a few struggles and challenges:

**Coordinating a Large Team:** Coordinating the schedules of 7 busy college students was a difficult task. We overcame this through Scrum methodology: standups twice a week, sprints, and Scrum reviews.

**Implementing real-time chat functionality:** Although we plan to implement this feature in a future version of the application, it proved to be a challenging task during the initial development phase.

**Backend/Frontend Conflicts:** While developing the frontend, we had to go back and make modifications to the backend and API to properly retrieve the appropriate information.

## What we would do differently next time

Looking back on the development process, there are a few things we would do differently in future projects:

**More thorough planning:** While we did have a plan in place for the project, we would like to spend more time upfront in future projects to ensure that we have a well-defined roadmap.

**More frequent testing:** Although we tested our code regularly throughout the project, we would like to incorporate more automated testing into our development process in the future.

**More streamlined code reviews:** While code reviews were an important part of our development process, we would like to streamline the review process to make it more efficient and less time-consuming.

## Future Development

In future versions of Study Buddies, we plan to add the following features:

* Chat functionality to allow group members to communicate in real-time
* Notifications for new messages and group activities
* Integration with UCF's course catalog to automatically populate study groups based on current classes
* Improved search functionality, including filters for study group size, meeting times, and more

## Conclusion

Study Buddies is a comprehensive study group platform that simplifies the process of finding and joining study groups. Our team of seven developers utilized a range of design patterns, data structures, and security measures to create an application that is user-friendly, scalable, and secure. With our mobile app built with React Native, Study Buddies provides easy access to study groups on-the-go. While we encountered some challenges during development, we were able to overcome them through effective communication and collaborative coding. Overall, we are proud of the work we have accomplished and look forward to continuing development on this project.
